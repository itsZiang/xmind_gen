Recording by Linda Lu,
Living without living in me, for a sacred land of Ampila.
Living without living in me, in such a way I hope that I will die because I will not die.
I already live outside of me, after I die of love, because I live in the Lord.
What did I want for myself, when I put my heart in him this letter that I die because I will not die.
This divine prison of love with which I live has made God my captive and free my heart and causes in me such a passion to see God my prisoner that I die because I will not die.
Oh, how long is this life, how hard are these lands, this prison, these lands in which the soul is put.
Just waiting for the exit causes me so much pain that I die because I will not die.
Oh, how long is this life, how hard are these lands, this prison, this prison, this prison, these lands in which the soul is put.
Oh, how long is this life, how hard are these lands, this prison, these lands in which the soul is put.
Only with confidence I live that I will die because by dying, living ensures my hope.
Death hurts to live if it reaches, do not delay, I wait for you, I die because I will not die.
Look that love is strong, life does not bother me, look that only you remain to win you, lose you, come that the sweet death,
the dying, come light, I die because I will not die.
Here I leave life above, it is the real life, until this life dies, I do not know what is alive,
death does not dodge me, I live by dying first, I die because I do not die.
Life that I can give to my God who lives in me, if it is not the loss of you, for better, to him, to kiss him, I want to die, to reach him,
because I love him so much that I die because I do not die.
