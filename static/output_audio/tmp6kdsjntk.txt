Sonneto 36. Por Garcilazo de la Vega
At the entrance of a valley in a desert, where no one crossed nor saw each other, I saw that with strangeness a can made ends of pain with discontent.
Now I release the can to the open sky, now I drag it through the road, walk, return, stop, and still I was dismayed as dead.
And it was that he left his presence to his love and did not find it, and this feels, looked until he reached the evil of absence.
He moved me with passion to see his accident. I told him, injured, be patient, that I achieve reason and I am absent.
End of poem.
