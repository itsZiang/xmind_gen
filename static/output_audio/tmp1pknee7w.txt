Recording by Linda Lu,
Living without living in me, for a sacred land of Ampila.
Living without living in me, in such a way I hope that I will die because I will not die.
I already live outside of me, after I die of love, because I live in the Lord.
What did I want for myself, when I put my heart in him this letter that I die because I will not die.
This divine prison of love with which I live has made God my captive and free my heart and causes in me such a passion to see God my prisoner that I die because I will not die.
Oh, how long is this life, how hard are these lands, this prison, these lands in which the soul is put.
Just waiting for the exit causes me so much pain that I die because I will not die.
Oh, how long is this life, how hard are these lands, this prison, this prison, this prison, these lands in which the soul is put.
Take away from me, God, this heavier burden than the steel that I die because I will not die.
Only with confidence I live that I want you to die, because dying to live ensures my hope.
Death hurts to live if it reaches you.
Do not be late.
What do I hope for you?
That I die because I do not die.
Look that love is strong.
Life does not bother me.
Look that only you remain.
To win you, to lose you.
Come that sweet death.
To die, come light.
That I die because I do not die.
Look that life above you.
It is the real life.
Until this life dies.
I do not know what is alive.
Death does not save me.
I live dying first.
I die because I do not die.
Life that I can give to my God.
Death that lives in me.
If it is not the loss of you,
for better, to him to enjoy.
I want to die to reach him.
Because so much to my beloved, I want to die because I do not die.
End of poem.
